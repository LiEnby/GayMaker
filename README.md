# GayMaker  
Homebrew GM:S Export tool  
  
Run the program. and browse to a GameMaker Studio project file (.gmx).  
you can also change the images, Title. and TitleID and then your game will be    
"compiled" for PSVITA and saved as a VPK to whereever you choose to save it  

Please show me any games you make with it!

# Errors
When the PSVita GameMaker Runner encounters an error. the error dialog is printed to stdout rather than opening a message box.  
if its a critical error. the app will simply exit afterwards.. i recommend using a plugin to capture stdout for any serious development.   
take a look at [ShipLog](https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-RE-tools/tree/master/ShipLog2.0/release) or [psp2shell](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/psp2shell)  

# Shaders
When you compile a project that uses Shaders for the first time. you'll be prompted to browse to 'psp2cgc.exe'  
This file will then be placed into the GayMaker install folder and you wont have to do it again after that.  
Shaders will compile into the GXP format. which will then work on the console itself.  

For *reasons*, i will not provide a link to psp2cgc.exe  
  
# Touchscreen  
To use touchscreen features, you have to enable "Use Rear Touch" and "Use Front Touch" in *Global Game Settings*  
Then you can use the mouse controls as touch inputs.  
  
Once enabled the touchscreen is mapped as a Mouse Device,  
so you can just use [Device Input](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/device%20input/index.html)  
  
Devices 0~4 are for the front touchscreen  
and Devices 5~8 are for the rear touchscreen  
*It acturally supports multiple touches at a time~*  
  
# Controller Mapping 
  
To Check PSVita Controls use the [GamePad](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/gamepad%20input/index.html) commands    
Here is what each control maps to:  

gp_face1 = CROSS  
gp_face2 = CIRCLE             
gp_face3 = SQUARE  
gp_face4 = TRIANGLE  
  
gp_shoulderl = L  
gp_shoulderr = R  
gp_shoulderlb = UNUSED  
gp_shoulderrb = UNUSED  
  
gp_select = SELECT  
gp_start = START  
  
gp_stickl = UNUSED  
gp_stickr = UNUSED  
  
gp_padu = DPAD UP  
gp_padd = DPAD DOWN  
gp_padl = DPAD LEFT  
gp_padr = DPAD RIGHT  
  
gp_axislh = LEFT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axislv = LEFT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES  
  
gp_axisrh = RIGHT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axisrv = RIGHT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES
